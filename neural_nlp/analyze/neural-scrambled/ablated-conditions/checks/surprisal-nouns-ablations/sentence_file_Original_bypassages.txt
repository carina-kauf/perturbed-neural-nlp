beekeeping encourages the conservation of local habitats. it is in every beekeeper's interest to conserve local plants that produce pollen. as a passive form of agriculture it does not require that native vegetation be cleared to make way for crops. beekeepers also discourage the use of pesticides on crops because they could kill the honeybees.
artisanal beekeepers go to extremes for their craft but their product is worth the effort. artisanal honey-making emphasizes quality and character over quantity and consistency. to produce the finest honey beekeepers become micromanagers of their honeybees. they scout the fields know when nectar flows and select the best ways to extract honey.
as the beekeeper opens the hive the deep hum of 40000 bees fills the air. the beekeeper checks honey stores pollen supplies and the bee nursery. bees crawl across his bare arms and hands but they don't sting because they're gentle.
i have a recurring dream about exams even though i'm no longer in college. in my dream it's the day of my final exam and i suddenly realize i've never gone to class. i've never even done any of the reading assignments. i know many other people who have the same nightmare.
each morning participants in the study had to write down their dream experience from the previous night. they recorded if they recalled any dreams and described each dream and its emotional intensity. participants then assigned each dream to a category such as a flying dream a bad dream or a nightmare.
every night while we sleep our minds are as active as when we are awake. we dream throughout the night in cycles of about ninety minutes each. images feelings stories and strange combinations of characters and places can fill our dreams.

the wind from the hurricane shook the house shattering a window in the kitchen. we ran in grabbed some food slammed the door and surrendered the kitchen to the hurricane. i was afraid our house would be ripped from its foundation. later that night with the wind shaking the house we fell asleep huddled on the sofa.
hurricanes can tear limbs off of trees and suck houses off their foundations. they dump heavy rains that can trigger floods and mudslides. hurricanes can also bring a storm surge a wall of ocean water that lurches onto land.
scientists use several methods to look for evidence of ancient hurricanes. the strongest storms deposited layers of windblown beach sand at the bottoms of coastal lakes. trees drenched by passing hurricanes preserve a record of each storm in their growth rings.
american ice cream is exported around the world but different countries have different preferences. many people enjoy their ice cream flavored with local delicacies. in some tropical places vanilla ice cream is topped with bananas and fresh mangos.
i remember making ice cream at home as a child. we poured the cream mixture into a frozen tub then start turning the crank to expose it to the cold. eventually it froze enough that i couldn't turn the hand crank any more. then i put the container of half-frozen ice cream into the freezer to harden.

astronauts train a long time for their spacewalks. much of their training is conducted underwater. they may spend 8 to 10 hours in the pool for every hour they will spend floating in space. astronauts practice to be able to perform construction and repair work on the outside of the space station.
the commanders of shuttle flights are always pilots and many have backgrounds as military test pilots. other astronauts are trained as doctors engineers and scientists who can run experiments in space. early crews were all young men but astronauts now are much more diverse.
the team of astronauts floated out together to the exterior of the space shuttle. they carried tools needed to repair the broken part on the huge telescope. one astronaut loosened the bolts on the pipe while the other fitted the replacement part into place.
computers have been used in art for a long time by experimental artists. now that computers are more affordable and widespread computer graphics have entered the mainstream art world. some computer science conferences have art exhibitions that showcase the latest graphics technology. brand new conferences have sprung up that are devoted to bridging the two cultures.
the computer graphics specialist works with doctors to visualize medical conditions and surgical procedures. she uses digital animation to help doctors understand structures within a patient's body. seeing the internal structures in an animation on a screen is much clearer than squinting at x-rays.

no one really knows exactly how a taste gets from your mouth to your brain. scientists think the process begins when a molecule of food touches a taste bud cell. the cell carries a taste message to taste nerves beneath the cell.

148	there are a few different types of bone fracture.	4.118873596191406	61.48994073756701
149	in closed or simple fractures the bone is broken but the skin is intact.	5.082694053649902	161.20777382811215
150	in open or compound fractures the broken bone has punctured the skin and produced an open wound.	4.854069709777832	128.26131544863125

163	early founders of opera chose tales from antiquity for their subject matter.	6.144309997558594	466.0579569635425
164	later operas branched out into different sources of stories and musical traditions.	4.945976734161377	140.6081205572429
165	opera is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a play that combines words and music.	3.823523759841919	45.76519006267656
166	it incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre such as acting scenery and costumes.	5.033855438232422	153.5237745709443
167	performances are typically given in an opera house and accompanied by an orchestra.	4.194897651672363	66.34694073135725
168	the opera singer has worked hard to win the role in the new production.	3.981269121170044	53.58499694592749
169	her job is not just about singing.	5.050994873046875	156.1777642699947

174	she has to execute the brush strokes with skill.	5.392890930175781	219.8380041128728
175	most importantly the content of the painting should reveal a glimpse of the painter's soul.	4.549306392669678	94.56679334097481
176	long ago painters were employed more as skilled artisans than as creative artists.	4.627131938934326	102.2204687405131
177	however prominent painters had the social status of scholars and members of the royal court.	4.892113208770752	133.23482978144284

179	as a painter i learned to focus less on the actual scene and more on the painting itself.	3.8161442279815674	45.42870745357962
180	an artist's eye is not a camera lens that has to record everything within its field of vision.	4.114769458770752	61.23809472961147

184	its large orange eyes are downright creepy and look like they could pierce right through you.	4.6623945236206055	105.88933333753268
185	this owl hunts at night flying swiftly and silently through the darkness.	5.165954113006592	175.20454378407362
186	while some owl species have become endangered others are thriving.	5.3496413230896	210.53277107875812
187	the barred owl has spread well beyond its previous habitat.	5.6399922370910645	281.4605335143087
188	early findings suggest that logging may have facilitated the barred owl's invasion.	5.9691314697265625	391.1657838450187
189	the owl landed on a thick branch and gripped it with her talons.	4.408617973327637	82.15584344238033
190	she pressed her wings to her sides and settled down half-closing an eye.	4.871349811553955	130.49694435102697

200	when hunting they will wait by a seal's breathing hole or stalk seals that are basking on the ice.	5.726211071014404	306.804602501258
201	the polar bear will crawl quietly forward and freeze in place when the seal looks around.	4.927114486694336	137.9807919490207
202	the medieval castle was not a structure built primarily for defense.	4.925422668457031	137.74755088517918
203	its purpose was to dominate its surroundings.	5.162562370300293	174.61130168158797
204	a castle could easily control lands within a day's walk.	5.515251159667969	248.45237062670915

225	all of the boys on the trip were new to rock climbing.	4.267977237701416	71.37711057034346
226	many were afraid of heights.	5.511353492736816	247.48587080851414

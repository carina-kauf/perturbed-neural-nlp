148	there are a few different types of bone fracture.	4.117891311645508	61.42956977463849
149	in closed or simple fractures the bone is broken but the skin is intact.	4.805661678314209	122.20032157909759
150	in open or compound fractures the broken bone has punctured the skin and produced an open wound.	4.324423789978027	75.52198379604707

161	modern opera started at the end of the sixteenth century.	4.059545993804932	57.94799635655012
162	it began as an effort to rediscover and imitate greek tragic performance.	5.193886756896973	180.16746093061255
163	early founders of opera chose tales from antiquity for their subject matter.	5.707250118255615	301.0420988492958
164	later operas branched out into different sources of stories and musical traditions.	4.862232685089111	129.3125943442813
165	opera is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a play that combines words and music.	3.3567240238189697	28.69503249018018
166	it incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre such as acting scenery and costumes.	4.848043441772461	127.49070267868005
167	performances are typically given in an opera house and accompanied by an orchestra.	3.830057382583618	46.06518149750428
168	the opera singer has worked hard to win the role in the new production.	4.507124423980713	90.66074146294177
169	her job is not just about singing.	5.320169925689697	204.41861501601156
170	acting stage presence and musical interpretation are all critical.	6.833385944366455	928.3287665695018
171	but her pure strong voice is certainly the star of the show.	4.642386436462402	103.79174467113288
172	a painter must keep many elements in mind while completing a painting.	4.484803199768066	88.65950088560464

174	she has to execute the brush strokes with skill.	5.677831649780273	292.314901150726
175	most importantly the content of the painting should reveal a glimpse of the painter's soul.	4.236959457397461	69.1971348176667
176	long ago painters were employed more as skilled artisans than as creative artists.	4.149484157562256	63.40128678700774
177	however prominent painters had the social status of scholars and members of the royal court.	4.32838773727417	75.8219430781388

179	as a painter i learned to focus less on the actual scene and more on the painting itself.	3.433743715286255	30.992452753708132
180	an artist's eye is not a camera lens that has to record everything within its field of vision.	3.7410151958465576	42.140749570673954

184	its large orange eyes are downright creepy and look like they could pierce right through you.	3.8470401763916016	46.854177693335835
185	this owl hunts at night flying swiftly and silently through the darkness.	4.6159257888793945	101.08136523202789
186	while some owl species have become endangered others are thriving.	5.259003162384033	192.28971410758194
187	the barred owl has spread well beyond its previous habitat.	5.159823417663574	174.13370395379684
188	early findings suggest that logging may have facilitated the barred owl's invasion.	5.242234230041504	189.09210606747783
189	the owl landed on a thick branch and gripped it with her talons.	3.863955020904541	47.653449546682545
190	she pressed her wings to her sides and settled down half-closing an eye.	4.727612018585205	113.02533742585139
191	she might have been a statue but for the glow of her eyes.	4.033028602600098	56.43156147463632
192	it's unnerving to watch a polar bear stalk across floating sea ice.	4.505670070648193	90.52898454524635
193	it's even worse when you are submerged in the frigid waters directly beneath the huge animal.	4.028532028198242	56.17838240570228

196	polar bears are one of the few animals that will attack people for reasons other than fear or confusion.	3.1633570194244385	23.649855841545
197	they may attack out of hunger because they live in a food-scarce environment.	3.7476468086242676	42.42113939477127
198	they will sneak up on people slowly careful to conserve their energy.	5.313147068023682	202.9880414155742
199	the seal is an important part of the polar bear's diet.	3.461737871170044	31.87231839547146
200	when hunting they will wait by a seal's breathing hole or stalk seals that are basking on the ice.	4.7530741691589355	115.94015689560378
201	the polar bear will crawl quietly forward and freeze in place when the seal looks around.	4.974612236022949	144.69270764894355
202	the medieval castle was not a structure built primarily for defense.	4.346484184265137	77.20654121960197
203	its purpose was to dominate its surroundings.	5.528724193572998	251.82242931911767
204	a castle could easily control lands within a day's walk.	5.490692138671875	242.424940480128
205	during times of attack peasants livestock and property could be brought inside the castle's walls for protection.	4.875312805175781	131.01512901222378
206	spectacular castles in dramatic locations provide a record of the stormy history of many regions.	4.778768062591553	118.95771128391814

212	after climbing fifty feet up the side of the pyramid the man gestured me into a small black entranceway.	4.257701873779297	70.64744001881611
213	this led into the chamber at the pyramid's center.	5.579799652099609	265.01850456609105
214	i followed him down the steep dark narrow passage.	5.497888088226318	244.17570979157563
215	the smell inside the pyramid was chalky and the air was thick.	4.390782356262207	80.70353320293772
216	more than just the tomb of the king pyramids represented the pride of the nation.	4.6165242195129395	101.14187352066428

219	architects are still working to solve the mysteries of how pyramids were constructed.	3.5026607513427734	33.20368126803228
220	some think ramps were built inside the pyramid's walls to raise stone blocks.	5.683987617492676	294.11993240083586
221	others speculate that ramps zigzagged up the exterior walls of the pyramid.	4.8510661125183105	127.87664809514425
222	even beginner rock climbing takes courage and strength.	6.065969467163086	430.9402576535003
223	climbers who are learning the sport can try scrambling on large boulders.	4.519779205322266	91.8153234052379
224	once they're comfortable with that they can begin using ropes to safely climb vertical rock faces.	4.387231349945068	80.4174626664637
225	all of the boys on the trip were new to rock climbing.	4.217044353485107	67.83269823115998
226	many were afraid of heights.	5.980133533477783	395.4931762086826
227	having someone else check their knots and harnesses helped them calm down.	5.616352558135986	274.88492571233814

237	a major strength of professional skiers is how they use ski poles.	4.59238338470459	98.72946025258537
238	proper use of ski poles improves their balance and adds flair to their skiing.	4.793212413787842	120.68844783496436
239	it minimizes the need for upper body movements to regain lost balance while skiing.	4.79747200012207	121.20362714448055
240	new ski designs and stiffer boots let skiers turn more quickly.	5.62960958480835	278.5533449436154
241	but faster and tighter turns increase the twisting force on the legs.	5.584348201751709	266.22670007841407

148	there are a few different types of bone fracture.	5.491831461588542	242.70129817081974
149	in closed or simple fractures the bone is broken but the skin is intact.	6.1718427794320245	479.06811003000746
150	in open or compound fractures the broken bone has punctured the skin and produced an open wound.	5.996203759137322	401.90018394250495

161	modern opera started at the end of the sixteenth century.	5.3651358127594	213.8202722302478
162	it began as an effort to rediscover and imitate greek tragic performance.	7.668545842170715	2139.967331340669
163	early founders of opera chose tales from antiquity for their subject matter.	7.680387496948242	2165.458717937202
164	later operas branched out into different sources of stories and musical traditions.	7.418965101242065	1667.3071205127196
165	opera is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a play that combines words and music.	4.673195706473456	107.03926250695295
166	it incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre such as acting scenery and costumes.	6.040626525878906	420.1561911679058
167	performances are typically given in an opera house and accompanied by an orchestra.	5.808319825392503	333.0590579285919
168	the opera singer has worked hard to win the role in the new production.	4.834398218563625	125.76287866459799
169	her job is not just about singing.	7.215706961495536	1360.6352448736552
170	acting stage presence and musical interpretation are all critical.	8.515406926472982	4991.07664739237
171	but her pure strong voice is certainly the star of the show.	5.897218585014343	364.0235578877415
172	a painter must keep many elements in mind while completing a painting.	5.857800245285034	349.95348487176386

174	she has to execute the brush strokes with skill.	7.190521240234375	1326.7946041296207
175	most importantly the content of the painting should reveal a glimpse of the painter's soul.	5.762454764048258	318.1283011186442
176	long ago painters were employed more as skilled artisans than as creative artists.	6.406798069293682	605.9503604671498
177	however prominent painters had the social status of scholars and members of the royal court.	6.522817611694336	680.4930518601874
178	they signed their work decided on its subject and imagery and established a personal relationship with their patrons.	6.446420907974243	630.4418406774894
179	as a painter i learned to focus less on the actual scene and more on the painting itself.	4.452168265978496	85.81280741956752
180	an artist's eye is not a camera lens that has to record everything within its field of vision.	5.029162671830919	152.80501117322117

182	the eagle owl is an impressive bird.	6.6722869873046875	790.200718550836
183	it has ear tufts that stick up like horns.	7.55075544781155	1902.17918579116
184	its large orange eyes are downright creepy and look like they could pierce right through you.	5.827993154525757	339.67631672394276
185	this owl hunts at night flying swiftly and silently through the darkness.	6.45744264125824	637.4288361661461
186	while some owl species have become endangered others are thriving.	6.95453372001648	1047.8898139748449
187	the barred owl has spread well beyond its previous habitat.	7.331989908218384	1528.4201637726014
188	early findings suggest that logging may have facilitated the barred owl's invasion.	7.958841959635417	2860.758160122482
189	the owl landed on a thick branch and gripped it with her talons.	5.765115811274602	318.97598291238535
190	she pressed her wings to her sides and settled down half-closing an eye.	7.1196651091942424	1236.0364269110548
191	she might have been a statue but for the glow of her eyes.	5.425380413348858	227.0977208897374
192	it's unnerving to watch a polar bear stalk across floating sea ice.	6.162090500195821	474.4188115247972
193	it's even worse when you are submerged in the frigid waters directly beneath the huge animal.	5.354620635509491	211.58369378548636

197	they may attack out of hunger because they live in a food-scarce environment.	6.053292567913349	425.5117524297158
198	they will sneak up on people slowly careful to conserve their energy.	6.714967489242554	824.656956239391
199	the seal is an important part of the polar bear's diet.	4.907343604347923	135.27958059985798
200	when hunting they will wait by a seal's breathing hole or stalk seals that are basking on the ice.	7.2331087212813525	1384.5199074122008
201	the polar bear will crawl quietly forward and freeze in place when the seal looks around.	5.850948452949524	347.56387218006387
202	the medieval castle was not a structure built primarily for defense.	6.268719759854403	527.8012328288577
203	its purpose was to dominate its surroundings.	7.37508910042899	1595.734004749438
204	a castle could easily control lands within a day's walk.	7.721351623535156	2256.0067926394445
205	during times of attack peasants livestock and property could be brought inside the castle's walls for protection.	6.652479676639333	774.7029585860927

212	after climbing fifty feet up the side of the pyramid the man gestured me into a small black entranceway.	5.811689878764906	334.1833781754938
213	this led into the chamber at the pyramid's center.	7.937499629126655	2800.34983414986
214	i followed him down the steep dark narrow passage.	7.410441716512044	1653.1564120958928
215	the smell inside the pyramid was chalky and the air was thick.	6.179718017578125	482.8557803117144

220	some think ramps were built inside the pyramid's walls to raise stone blocks.	7.132789245018592	1252.3652533533011
221	others speculate that ramps zigzagged up the exterior walls of the pyramid.	8.114681482315063	3343.1925486218192

223	climbers who are learning the sport can try scrambling on large boulders.	7.257001876831055	1417.998822690365
224	once they're comfortable with that they can begin using ropes to safely climb vertical rock faces.	6.018584370613098	410.9963651801039
225	all of the boys on the trip were new to rock climbing.	5.33497154712677	207.46684569609937
226	many were afraid of heights.	8.818165588378907	6755.860222854385

240	new ski designs and stiffer boots let skiers turn more quickly.	7.785428827459162	2405.297384415575
241	but faster and tighter turns increase the twisting force on the legs.	6.898478269577026	990.7658892869589
